Why forget someone birthday , this C# solution is for you . 

I worked in team where we used to celebrate everyone birthday by decorating thier cubicle before they
comes up in morning and that was responsibility of my group to make sure this is done .

Few times I forget couple of team members birthday and could not arrange decoration for thier cubicle before thier arrival , so I wrote this
C# service which used to send me reminder email 1 day prior so I can plan accordingly .

This C# library can be used as Windows service

Input - A excel file with Team Member Name and DOB. Please do make changes as per your requirement .
